# mvctemplate
A Model/View/Controller template for Java with multiple views

This is a ModelViewController package for java I wrote for a personal project of mine in order to minimize the hassle of dealing with user interface issues.
One of the goals of the project was to support multiple user interfaces. 
Both command line and Java Swing with the architecture in place to support more if the need should arise. 
There is a companion project on Github - https://github.com/igorpiltz/MvcTemplateExample which is a Hello World-type
implementation example meant as an example to copy for new projects.
